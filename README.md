# Smart Payemt Gateway using Tezos Blockchain 

---

## Overview

This repository contains the full backend process for a payment system that facilitates the conversion between fiat currency and cryptocurrency using the Onmeta API. The system includes a smart contract written in SmartPy language on the Tezos blockchain platform, as well as a JavaScript middleware to interact with the smart contract and handle payment requests from users. The project aims to provide a seamless solution for industries to initiate payments, allowing them to transfer salaries in either cryptocurrency or fiat currency, using stable coins like USD.

Industries across various sectors can leverage this payment system to modernize their payment processes, offering employees the flexibility to receive their salaries in their preferred form of currency - either as cryptocurrencies or traditional cash. By integrating this solution, industries can streamline payroll processes, reduce transaction costs, and provide employees with more options for managing their finances.

## Prerequisites

- Tezos Development Environment
- Python 
- SmartPy Compiler
- Onmeta API Access
- Node.js and npm for JavaScript middleware

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Set up the Tezos development environment and ensure that the SmartPy compiler is installed.

3. Obtain access to the Onmeta API for fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat conversion functionalities.

4. Install Node.js and npm for the JavaScript middleware.

## Usage

1. Compile the smart contract using the SmartPy compiler.

2. Deploy the compiled smart contract to the Tezos blockchain.

3. Set up the JavaScript middleware to interact with the deployed smart contract and handle payment requests from users.

4. Users can initiate payment requests through the frontend interface, which communicates with the JavaScript middleware.

5. The JavaScript middleware processes payment requests, interacts with the smart contract to perform fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat conversions using the functionalities provided by the Onmeta API, and handles the transfer of funds accordingly.




# Configuration:
Ensure that you have obtained the necessary API access credentials for the Onmeta API and configure them properly in the smart contract code.
